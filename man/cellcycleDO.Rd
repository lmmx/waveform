\title{
The residual dissolved oxygen data from data from Kalesh Sasidharan, Cornelia Amariei, Masaru Tomita and Douglas B. Murray[1]
}
\description{
The dataset consists of the residual dissolved oxygen data measured during time-series sampling during the respiratory oscillation. Flow cytometric measurements of peak height from 64 samples taken during the yeast respiratory oscillation. Measurements were taken during this experiment.

\usage{data(cellcycleDO)}
\format{
  A data frame with 457 observations on the following 4 variables.

    \item{\code{time.sec}}{time in seconds}
    \item{\code{DO}}{residual dissolved oxygen concentration (\%)}
    \item{\code{angle}}{the phase angle of the cycle wrt the minimum firts derivative of \code{DO} (Â°)}
    \item{\code{sample}}{a numeric vector indicating the sample ID's}
