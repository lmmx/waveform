Description: Oscillations play a significant role in biological systems, 
  with many examples in the fast, ultradian, circadian, circalunar and 
  yearly time domains. However, determining periodicity in such data can 
  be problematic. There are a number of computational methods to identify 
  the periodic components in large datasets, such as signal-to-noise 
  based Fourier decomposition, Fisher's g-test and autocorrelation. 
  However, the available methods assume a sinusoidal model and do not 
  attempt to quantify the waveform shape and the presence of multiple periodicities, 
  which provide vital clues in determining the underlying dynamics. 
  Here, we developed a Fourier based measure that generates a de-noised 
  waveform from multiple significant frequencies. This waveform is then 
  correlated with the raw data from the respiratory oscillation found in yeast, 
  to provide oscillation statistics including waveform metrics and multi-periods. 
  The method is compared and contrasted to commonly used statistics. 
  Moreover, we show the utility of the program in the analysis of noisy datasets
  and other high-throughput analyses, such as metabolomics and flow cytometry, respectively.
